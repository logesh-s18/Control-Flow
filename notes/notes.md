Control Flow

### 8.2 — If statements and blocks													 |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## New things I learned

- always use blocks in for condition statment control flow body, bcz, if/else without block/braces only include very next single statement.
- using { } will make include all required statements, better for readability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Important notes / rules

- Best Practice : always use braces {} to create a block for the conditional cotrol flow body statements
- I did a mistake where unknowingly redeclared variable inside another scope without understanding scope, lifetime, duration. Now im clear.
- Be careful while Re-dec, it will cause again a new decalration which will die inside its relevant scope and the same outside variable will not be changed.
