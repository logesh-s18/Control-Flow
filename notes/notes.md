Control Flow

### 8.2 — If statements and blocks													 |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## New things I learned

- always use blocks in for condition statment control flow body, bcz, if/else without block/braces only include very next single statement.
- using { } will make include all required statements, better for readability.
- dont accidently put ';' beside conditions, it will assume as null statement and will always execute next line.

## Important notes / rules

- Best Practice : always use braces {} to create a block for the conditional cotrol flow body statements
- I did a mistake where unknowingly redeclared variable inside another scope without understanding scope, lifetime, duration. Now im clear.
- Be careful while Re-dec, it will cause again a new decalration which will die inside its relevant scope and the same outside variable will not be changed.



- If statement pakkadhula accidental-a semicolon (;) pota, adhu "null statement"-ah maaridun. C++ nenaikum "if condition mudinjiduchu" nu.
  Definition: Semicolon denotes the end of a statement. If condition kulla semicolon pota, condition true-ah irundhalum illatiyum adutha line run aagidum.
